# Welcome to My Robot Project - By Simon Czerwinski

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Simon Czerwinski. This is my Robot project where I showcase some of my skills as a frontend developer with full-stack experience.

## About Me

I'm a frontend developer based in Halmstad, Sweden. My journey in web development started in the middle of my senior high school in the year 2011. I started my first job in January 2015. I've had the pleasure of working on a variety of projects that have honed my skills in both frontend and backend technologies.

## What You'll Find Here

This repository serves as a small robot that takes commands from an input (e.g., F = Forward, R = Right, and L = Left). It can also take commands in Swedish (e.g., G = GÃ¥ (Go), H = HÃ¶ger (Right), and V = VÃ¤nster (Left)). An example of an input in Swedish can be "GHHHVGGGVV".

## Technologies

This project is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: I use HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and the JavaScript library React.

- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.3.3

- **State Management**: XState helps me manage complex UI state transitions. It provides a clear way to represent and handle different states in my applications.

- **Backend**: I work with Node.js for backend development, building APIs to support my frontend applications.

- **Database**: MongoDB to save input history.

## Getting Started

To start this project locally, follow this guide:

Install all dependencies and packages.

```bash
npm install
```

After the installation is done, make sure you are in the project directory, then run:

```bash
npm start
```

This runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

To run tests, use:

```bash
npm test
```

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

To build the app for production to the build folder, use:

```bash
npm run build
```

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

To run Cypress tests, make sure the app is running by starting it with:

```bash
npm start
```

Then, open a new terminal and run the following script:

```bash
npm run cypress:open
```

or

```bash
npx cypress open
```

## Future Goals

- **Login**: I plan to add a login system.

- **Api**: Improve the API handler and mocking.

- **More layouts**: I will create more layouts for the robot to choose from.

- **Navbar**: Implement a menu with pages..

- **Zustand**: Maybe implement Zustand to test new stuff.
